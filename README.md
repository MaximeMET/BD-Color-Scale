# BD-Color-Scale
**Create a Custom Color Scale from an Image**

When creating contour maps, selecting an appropriate color scale is crucial. In this example, you are working with the **OriginPro** application's Color Editor.

This software enables you to generate a color scale from any image of your choice. After inputting an image, the software outputs a `.txt` file containing 256 rows and 3 columns, where each row represents the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values of the corresponding color.

## How it Works

1. **Input**: Provide an image file.
2. **Output**: The software generates a `.txt` file with 256 RGB values, ready to use in your color scale editor.

### Example Use Case
- Import the output `.txt` file into **OriginPro** Color Editor or any other compatible software to apply the custom color scale to your contour map.
